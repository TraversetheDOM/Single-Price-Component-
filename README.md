## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My use of grid and flex-box seems to be getting much better after several practice.

### Continued development

I would keep on doing more projects to get better at my CSS as well as using the proper HTML syntax when structuring my code.

### Useful resources

- [cssgenerator.org](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This was a useful css generator I used to get the box shadow which was used for this project. I would recommmend this if you need a goood css genrator to save you some time.
